","body":"### Parkwood Vale Harriers\r\nThis is a training log application for my CG2 Computing coursework. It is built using Flask, Jinja2 and JavaScript, with a number of other open source projects, such as Bootstrap, also included. It's easy to get started with it - just download the files, and run the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ virtualenv env\r\n$ source env/bin/activate\r\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n$ python manange.py runserver\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's still in development, and very little actually works yet (read: nothing), but it's coming along nicely, and should be feature complete by Aprilish.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
